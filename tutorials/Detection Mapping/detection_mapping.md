## 1.  Why do we need spatial data?
The study of species habitat is a key component in understanding and managing wildlife. Thus, being able to collect, process, and manipulate spatial data is cruciual to this field. Though spatial information is increadibly useful to inform hypotheses and statistical analyses, it is also an incredibly powerful tool for storytelling via mapping.
