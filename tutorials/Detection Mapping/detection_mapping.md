## 1.  Why do we need spatial data?
A key component in studying and managing wildlife is to better understand wildife habitat, or where species are found in space and time. Thus, being able to incorperate spatial data into statistical and reporting tools is crucial. Though spatial information is increadibly useful when stored as metadata and implemented in analyses, it is an incredibly powerful tool for mapping and storytelling.
