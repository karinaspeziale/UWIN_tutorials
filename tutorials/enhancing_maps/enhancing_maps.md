# UWIN Tutorial: Enhancing maps with OpenStreetMap Data
*Created by Kim Rivera and Tiziana Gelmi-Candusso - last updated December 2024*

This tutorial is aimed at those interested in (1) advancing their spatial mapping skills and (2) integrating OpenStreetMap and other data sources to enhance exisiting spatial datasets. 
This tutorial builds on work described in the manuscript, 
['Leveraging Open-Source Geographic Databases to Enhance the Representation of Landscape Heterogeneity in Ecological Models' (2024)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.70402) by Gelmi-Candusso T., Rodriguez P., Fidino, M., Rivera, K., Lehrer, E.W., Magle, S., & Fortin M.

## 1. What is OpenStreetMap and why should we use these data?
Wildlife ecology and behavior are strongly driven by landscape characteristics, especially in urban regions. Cities are among the world's most heterogeneous landscapes however, global land cover maps often represent urban areas as a single, homogeneous class therefore limiting our ability to build useful spatial ecological models over large scales. However, we can use community-based geographic databases, such as OpenStreetMap (OSM), to improve the quality and spatial resolution of urban land cover data. OSM is an open-source mapping platform storing landscape information in the form of geographic polygon features identified by a series of attributes. 

Take the below example of Chicago, Illinois (USA). On the left we see a relativley homogenous ladnscape of 'urban' land cover (in red) from the Commission for Environmental Cooperation Land Use Land Cover data. On the right we have the same dataset overlaid by spatial data collected from OSM. We can see OSM greatly improves our ability to asses heterogeneity in the urban landscape and therefore improve our understanding of urban wildlife ecology.

Vegetation areas are represented in green shades, barren soil in brown, built environment or land use areas are represented in red shades, different road types are represented in yellow shades, and building footprints are represented in black." width="1000" height="auto" />

OSM data generated by community members are supplemented with information from governmental and non-governmental agencies around the globe and these data have been reliably used in diverse ecological research studies. Extracting a few features from the OSM database for small areas can be done directly online, however, extracting larger study areas, or extracting the full database is much more difficult. Therefore, we outline the framework to inetgrate OSM data as described in [Gelmi-Candusso et al., 2024](https://github.com/tgelmi-candusso/OSM_for_Ecology.git).
