## Autologistic occupancy models

- The most simple version of a dynamic occupancy model
  + Estimates occupancy each time step
  + No separate linear predictors for local colonization and extinction
  + Well suited when you are interested in patterns of species occupancy (you most often are)
  + Works far better than standard dynamic occupancy models when you have a smaller sample size (you most often do)

## The math in a nutshell

::: incremental
- For $i$ in $1,\dots,I$ sites
- For $t$ in $1,\dots,T$ sampling periods (e.g., UWIN sampling season)
- Let $z_{i,t}$ be the occupancy state of your species
