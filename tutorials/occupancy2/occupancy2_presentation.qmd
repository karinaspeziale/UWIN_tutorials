## Autologistic occupancy models

- The most simple version of a dynamic occupancy model
  + Estimates occupancy each time step
  + No separate linear predictors for local colonization and extinction
  + Well suited when you are interested in patterns of species occupancy (you most often are)
  + Works far better than standard dynamic occupancy models when you have a smaller sample size (you most often do)

## The math in a nutshell

## The math in a nutshell


- For $i$ in $1,\dots,I$ sites
- For $t$ in $1,\dots,T$ sampling periods (e.g., UWIN sampling season)
- Let $z_{i,t}$ be the occupancy state of your species

The probability of occupancy during the first season ($t = 1$) is then treated as Bernoulli trial:
$$
z_{i,t=1} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\psi)
$$
where $\psi$ is the probabiliy of occupancy.

## The math in a nutshell

If there is spatial (or temporal variation) you can make $\psi$ a function of covariates via the logit link

$$
\begin{align}
\text{logit}(\psi_{i,t=1}) & = \beta_0 + \beta_{forest}\times x_{forest, i} \\
z_{i,t=1} & \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\psi_{i,t})
\end{align}
$$
## The math in a nutshell

After the first timestep we introduce our autologistic term, $\theta$. It get's added to our logit linear predictor if and only if the species was present in the previous timestep. How do we do that?

$$
\begin{align}
\text{logit}(\psi_{i,t}) & = \beta_0 + \beta_{forest}\times x_{forest, i} + \theta \times z_{i,t-1} \\
z_{i,t} & \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\psi_{i,t}), \; \; \; t>1
\end{align}
$$
## The math in a nutshell

If the species is not present at $t-1$, then $z_{i,t-1} = 0$:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{logit}(\psi_{i,t=1}) & = \beta_0 + \beta_{forest}\times x_{forest, i} \\
z_{i,t=1} & \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\psi_{i,t})
\end{align}
$$

## The math in a nutshell

If the species is not present at $t-1$, then $z_{i,t-1} = 0$:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{logit}(\psi_{i,t=1}) & = \beta_0 + \beta_{forest}\times x_{forest, i} \\
z_{i,t=1} & \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\psi_{i,t})
\end{align}
$$
If the species is present at $t-1$, the  $z_{i,t-1} = 1$:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{logit}(\psi_{i,t=1}) & = \beta_0 + \beta_{forest}\times x_{forest, i} \\
z_{i,t=1} & \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\psi_{i,t})
\end{align}
$$
