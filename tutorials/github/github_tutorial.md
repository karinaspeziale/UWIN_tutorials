## GitHub tutorial

By: Nathan Byer and Mason Fidino

In this tutorial, we will go over some basics of how to use GitHub. Throughout, we will focus on the use of GitHub Desktop for repository management, but just remember - **this is just one of a few approaches you can use!** Here are a few notes on this before we proceed:

1. RStudio has native GitHub integration. It can be a bit limited in functionality, but can be useful for R-based repository management. 
2. Git has robust command-line utilities, some of which may be needed for more advanced repository management. It is also exhaustively documented elsewhere.

With these caveats in mind, let's get started with GitHub!

### Creating a GitHub account

Before using GitHub, there's a pretty important initial step: **you need to sign up for a GitHub account!** If you have already done this, feel free to proceed to the next section.

First, navigate to github.com. You should see the following:

Go ahead and enter your email in the box we have outlined in red, and proceed with any instructions necessary. You will be prompted to create a username and password, so make sure you remember what those are!

Now that you have an account, when you navigate to github.com, you should see the following:

This is your *dashboard*. We won't go into a ton of detail about this, but your recently used repositories should be displayed on the left (outlined in a green box), whereas a feed of repository-related activity for your collaborators will be displayed in the center (outlined in a blue box). 

### Creating a GitHub Repository

In the previous image, you likely noticed the little green button that says"New". Go ahead and click on that - to create your first github repository!

You should see something that looks like this:

As you can see in this image, fill in a name (I suggested one related to this tutorial, but it doesn't really matter!). Then, go ahead and click "add read me" - we will describe that a bit further below.

Towards the bottom of this page, you should see a few other options:

The .gitignore allows you to tell github *not* to track certain files in local repository folders, which can be useful. 

Note that you can also set a license for your repository! These outline usage rights, limitations, and terms for your repository.

You can safely ignore those for now, but just be aware of these for future repositories. For now, go ahead and click the green "create repository" button at the bottom to proceed.
