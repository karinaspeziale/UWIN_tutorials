## UWIN workshop: GitHub and Data Reproducibility

Nathan Byer and Mason Fidino

## How do researchers typically store files?

- `paper_draft.docx`
- `paper_draft2.docx`
- `paper_draft2_MF.docx`
- `paper_final.docx`
- `paper_final2.docx`
- `paper_final_revision.docx`

## Why is this a problem?

- How do you keep track of edits?
- How do we handle "accidents"?
- fundamentally, an issue with *data reproducibility*.

## Why worry about data reproducibility?

- We are currently experiencing a crisis of reproducibility in science!
- In response to this, code review is now a required component of peer review for many journals.
- Better, more reproducible code also makes it easier to standardize methodology.

## Git and GitHub

## What is GitHub?

- GitHub is **an easier, user-friendly way to use Git online**
- integrates with a number of other software platforms - including RStudio

# A brief overview of GitHub terminology

## Repository

- **Definition**: essentially, a project directory - where code, documents, and everything associated with a project will live.
- By default, typically contains a **README.md** file that describes the repository. 

## Clone

- **Definition**: the creation of a *local* copy of a *remote* repository.

## Commit
- **Definition**: a summary of changes made to files within a repository.
- typically capture the following:
  + a commit log, explaining the commit and its contributor(s)
  + a unique hash ID 
  + the **parent** commit - basically, where your commit came from!
  + a summary of files that have changed
  
## Push

- **Definition**: when *local* commits are pushed to the *remote* repository.
- What do we mean by this?
  + you will likely be creating a commit on a local machine.
  + after you create that commit, it will **not** be reflected in the remote repository until those changes are pushed.

## Pull

-**Definition**: when *remote* changes are applied to your *local*, cloned repository.
- What do we mean by this?
  + if you are working on a repository collaboratively, others may make edits that are **not** initially reflected in your local repository. 
  + when you pull from the remote repository, these remote changes are synced with your local directory.
